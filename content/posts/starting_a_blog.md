I am making this blog to mainly have an accessilbe web page with a list of my projects.

Perhaps I will also add a blog post from time to time but I am not sure why.

The site is created using Hugo and it is a pretty interesting tool. I am thinking what are the benefits over a simple php scripts.
It has some features for content management and using a ready made template is nice.
